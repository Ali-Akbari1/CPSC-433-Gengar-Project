Genetic Algorithm & OR Tree Solution


TO RUN:

python3 runMe.py (YOUR FILE NAME) input (for example: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)

NOTE: Moderatly large sized inputs (~12 or more) at times fall into what we think is an infinite loop, and at times goes through and works.
You may need to try moderatly sized games and practces under under size(12) multiple times.
